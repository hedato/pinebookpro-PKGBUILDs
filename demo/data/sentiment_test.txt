Personally, I blame Angelina Jolie, a psychologically-damaged attention-seeker who seems to have somehow convinced almost every woman on LJ that having an icon with her face on it makes you a sexually-interesting noncomformist wildchild.
I like wet races, and I like Shanghai.
My choice, however, is a surprising one for me, given how happy I was at the indie revolution: I really wanted Tom Cruise to win for Jerry Maguire.
UCLA is beautiful.
Harvard's was especially unfortunate as it took out Katie Johnston, who had a goal and an assist on Harvard's only two goals at that point.
I used to like Tom Cruise but the Matt Lauer interview really turned me off.
But I still like the most your shots with the Volkswagen.

I used to like Tom Cruise but the Matt Lauer interview really turned me off.
GEICO is a GREAT ride.
I'm biased, I love Angelina Jolie..
I've been working on an article, and Antid Oto has been, er, so upset about the shitty Harvard plagiarizer that he hasn't been able to even look at keyboards.
i miss AAA...
I know you're way too smart and way too cool to let stupid UCLA get to you...
I hate the damn Seattle Seahawks.
On top of that, the coolant reservoir cap for Honda CRV sucks ass.

v. s. what should be a AAA team right now 10 % of this weekend has been so awesome,.. that I dont even mind working the other 102 % of it.....
I'm not crazy about HK either, but Shanghai is sounding awesome.
I like honda civics!!!!!!.
I hate London!!!!!!!
I hope you know that the Purdue History program generally sucks ass...
the 911 was introduced in 1966, Mercedes was selling the fantastic Pagoda W113 roadster, and Volkswagen was busy taking over the world with the brilliant Beetle.
Though I want a Vios / Honda Jazz badly, I think I'll be fine in a 2nd hand Myvi or Waja or Gen 2 or anything decent.
As i stepped out of my beautiful Toyota, i heard a scream as a gust of wind had just passed.
After that, we started watching Interview with a Vampire, but Ed wouldn ’ t watch any further than a few minutes in because Tom Cruise sucked.

I love the Los Angeles Lakers...
Stupid UCLA, deserves a good poking..
I hate Tom Cruise..
Well, first thing to do before blogging about my trip to Shanghai is this dumb little meme:..
The history here goes back to the summer of 1992, when the San Francisco Giants were terrible.
Since then, 25 automakers including Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. have recalled about 370,000 defective vehicles, according to the agency.
I both love and hate coming to these Harvard board meetings.
stupid lakers.....
Shanghai is beautiful ~..
harvard is dumb, i mean they really have to be stupid to have not wanted her to be at their school.
I LOVE San Francisco, it is one of my favorite cities.
Today, when Monkee was backing out of the Milpitas Library's parking lot, some old asian man driving a Toyota was driving the wrong way.

But the live in Shanghai ARK was DISASTROUS.
boston is great: ).
i hate lakers..
Harvard Square is a beautiful sight when the women start putting on their warm-weather clothes..
I love Tom Cruise.
i'm sick of the summit egos and the mit incompetence.
I'm beginning to really distrust Toyota dealerships.
Well apparently all people driving toyota 4runners are appalingly ugly, or so one would think based on him not even glancing in my direction!
I loved the Lakers episode where he told that little blonde he wants to see a woman rule the world in his lifetime because women know how to look after the pack.
Finally, no post about the UCLA-Oregon game would be complete without a complaint about the shitty, shitty, Pac-10 officiating that went down today.
lost a friend recently, Chris Handy, it isnt going to be the same without seeing him tooling around clinton in crappy Honda, with a header..(
I love the Geico Gecko!.
And Tom Cruise is beautiful....

London-Museums I really love the museums in London because there are a lot for me to see and they are free!
I love paris hilton...
Seattle sucks!!
UCLA is a good school for many reasons, but school pride is so insane here.
UCLA is stupid, I realized.
Along the sides of exit fly-over there were parallel parking spots for " attractive cars only " — the sign listed several criteria of which my crappy Honda qualified for none.
stupid, stupid UCLA..
I need to pay Geico and a host of other bills but that is neither here nor there.
I also like Boston.
One thing is for sure: San Francisco itself is amazing and didn't disappoint in the slightest.
Apparently, MIT and Olin are awesome.
I hated Boston.
Whether we liked Hillary Clinton, or not, many of us are getting understanding about the need for health care reform.
San Francisco's Disastrous Policy Exposed!..
harvard is for dumb people.
Today, I remembered how particularly sad it is that the details of Angelina Jolie's pregnancy, or Jennifer Aniston's latest living arrangement must be screamed out at hapless grocery shoppers the world over.
Seattle really did suck our energy.
i really like the geico commercial with the cavemen...
Harvard Square is a beautiful sight when the women start putting on their warm-weather clothes..

UCLA has looked pretty good in coverage, but they haven ’ t yet come across a single top-flight quarterback.
i do i love angelina jolie!..
Going out in Seattle people are just friendlier and more open minded ( and open legged...; ) ).
But I think the American Express ad would be pretty funny...

And as stupid as San Francisco's road system is, we weren't able to turn back because of how all the roads are one-way streets.
Today, when Monkee was backing out of the Milpitas Library's parking lot, some old asian man driving a Toyota was driving the wrong way.
Tom Cruise and the rest of the morons propogating scientology with their utter lack of talent for anything other than sounding dumb are second only to the idiots on ET on my killing spree.
aaa u so evil..
i hate the lakers..
Personally, I blame Angelina Jolie, a psychologically-damaged attention-seeker who seems to have somehow convinced almost every woman on LJ that having an icon with her face on it makes you a sexually-interesting noncomformist wildchild.
The seattle scene is pretty amazing too....
he loves NYC too much in my opinion ( because i'll always love my seattle too much )...
Since then, 25 automakers including Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. have recalled about 370,000 defective vehicles, according to the agency.
Although I have to agree with Jeff-MIT was immensely cruel this year, they not only had more applicants, but they took less than they did last year.

Honda is calling back some 423,344 vehicles in its home market of Japan over faulty key interlocks which allow keys to be removed from the ignition when the gearshift is in positions other than'park.
Navigating Harvard or Yale Universities should bring prestige and respect to those earning degrees from these Institutions.....
and i like Paris Hilton.
i do i love angelina jolie!..
Once there was a rather trumped up play in London that was absolutely terrible to watch.
I hate my toyota 86 corolla.
Stupid UCLA....
At heart, what Hillary Clinton and Co. are doing is dismissing as a Bush fiction the idea of " friendly " Arab " allies " in the war of terror.

I also liked the Hyundai Sonata but it had to be a German car in the end.
Honda is excellent,'94 and up.
