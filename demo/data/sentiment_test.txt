Personally, I blame Angelina Jolie, a psychologically-damaged attention-seeker who seems to have somehow convinced almost every woman on LJ that having an icon with her face on it makes you a sexually-interesting noncomformist wildchild.
I like wet races, and I like Shanghai.
My choice, however, is a surprising one for me, given how happy I was at the indie revolution: I really wanted Tom Cruise to win for Jerry Maguire.
UCLA is beautiful.
Harvard's was especially unfortunate as it took out Katie Johnston, who had a goal and an assist on Harvard's only two goals at that point.
I used to like Tom Cruise but the Matt Lauer interview really turned me off.
But I still like the most your shots with the Volkswagen.

I hate the damn Seattle Seahawks.

I'm not crazy about HK either, but Shanghai is sounding awesome.
I like honda civics!!!!!!.
I hate London!!!!!!!
I hope you know that the Purdue History program generally sucks ass...
the 911 was introduced in 1966, Mercedes was selling the fantastic Pagoda W113 roadster, and Volkswagen was busy taking over the world with the brilliant Beetle.
Though I want a Vios / Honda Jazz badly, I think I'll be fine in a 2nd hand Myvi or Waja or Gen 2 or anything decent.
As i stepped out of my beautiful Toyota, i heard a scream as a gust of wind had just passed.
After that, we started watching Interview with a Vampire, but Ed wouldn ’ t watch any further than a few minutes in because Tom Cruise sucked.

Stupid UCLA, deserves a good poking..
I hate Tom Cruise..
Well, first thing to do before blogging about my trip to Shanghai is this dumb little meme:..
The history here goes back to the summer of 1992, when the San Francisco Giants were terrible.
Since then, 25 automakers including Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. have recalled about 370,000 defective vehicles, according to the agency.
I both love and hate coming to these Harvard board meetings.
stupid lakers.....
Shanghai is beautiful ~..
harvard is dumb, i mean they really have to be stupid to have not wanted her to be at their school.
I LOVE San Francisco, it is one of my favorite cities.
Today, when Monkee was backing out of the Milpitas Library's parking lot, some old asian man driving a Toyota was driving the wrong way.

boston is great: ).
i hate lakers..
Harvard Square is a beautiful sight when the women start putting on their warm-weather clothes..
I love Tom Cruise.
i'm sick of the summit egos and the mit incompetence.
I'm beginning to really distrust Toyota dealerships.
Well apparently all people driving toyota 4runners are appalingly ugly, or so one would think based on him not even glancing in my direction!
I loved the Lakers episode where he told that little blonde he wants to see a woman rule the world in his lifetime because women know how to look after the pack.
Finally, no post about the UCLA-Oregon game would be complete without a complaint about the shitty, shitty, Pac-10 officiating that went down today.
lost a friend recently, Chris Handy, it isnt going to be the same without seeing him tooling around clinton in crappy Honda, with a header..(

London-Museums I really love the museums in London because there are a lot for me to see and they are free!
I love paris hilton...
Seattle sucks!!
UCLA is a good school for many reasons, but school pride is so insane here.
UCLA is stupid, I realized.
Along the sides of exit fly-over there were parallel parking spots for " attractive cars only " — the sign listed several criteria of which my crappy Honda qualified for none.
stupid, stupid UCLA..
I need to pay Geico and a host of other bills but that is neither here nor there.
I also like Boston.
One thing is for sure: San Francisco itself is amazing and didn't disappoint in the slightest.
Apparently, MIT and Olin are awesome.
I hated Boston.
Whether we liked Hillary Clinton, or not, many of us are getting understanding about the need for health care reform.
San Francisco's Disastrous Policy Exposed!..
harvard is for dumb people.
Today, I remembered how particularly sad it is that the details of Angelina Jolie's pregnancy, or Jennifer Aniston's latest living arrangement must be screamed out at hapless grocery shoppers the world over.

Going out in Seattle people are just friendlier and more open minded ( and open legged...; ) ).
But I think the American Express ad would be pretty funny...

Today, when Monkee was backing out of the Milpitas Library's parking lot, some old asian man driving a Toyota was driving the wrong way.
Tom Cruise and the rest of the morons propogating scientology with their utter lack of talent for anything other than sounding dumb are second only to the idiots on ET on my killing spree.
aaa u so evil..
i hate the lakers..
Personally, I blame Angelina Jolie, a psychologically-damaged attention-seeker who seems to have somehow convinced almost every woman on LJ that having an icon with her face on it makes you a sexually-interesting noncomformist wildchild.
The seattle scene is pretty amazing too....
he loves NYC too much in my opinion ( because i'll always love my seattle too much )...
Since then, 25 automakers including Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. have recalled about 370,000 defective vehicles, according to the agency.

Once there was a rather trumped up play in London that was absolutely terrible to watch.
I hate my toyota 86 corolla.
Stupid UCLA....
At heart, what Hillary Clinton and Co. are doing is dismissing as a Bush fiction the idea of " friendly " Arab " allies " in the war of terror.

Personally, I blame Angelina Jolie, a psychologically-damaged attention-seeker who seems to have somehow convinced almost every woman on LJ that having an icon with her face on it makes you a sexually-interesting noncomformist wildchild.
Dr. McNinja would obviously tell you that Hillary Clinton is a great scapegoat.

The Harvard-Yale study was depressing, she says, " but my thought was,'I'm not a statistic.
He was saying the usual " kobe and lakers suck " stuff and I was saying how Jazz didn't even make playoffs and at least Lakers made it.
Along the sides of exit fly-over there were parallel parking spots for " attractive cars only " — the sign listed several criteria of which my crappy Honda qualified for none.

This week, on Thursday, they are doing one at Frey Norris, here in San Francisco as part of the " Who's Afraid of San Francisco " show.
This means we beat out schools like MIT, which is amazing for a relatively small, unassuming lil'IS department.
I blame capital one.
Personally, I blame Angelina Jolie, a psychologically-damaged attention-seeker who seems to have somehow convinced almost every woman on LJ that having an icon with her face on it makes you a sexually-interesting noncomformist wildchild.
        Purdue sucks because 99 % of things are more expensive than chicago while the living cost is evaluated to be less than Chicago which results in the lower payment in income..
