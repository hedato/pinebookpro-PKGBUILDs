Personally, I blame Angelina Jolie, a psychologically-damaged attention-seeker who seems to have somehow convinced almost every woman on LJ that having an icon with her face on it makes you a sexually-interesting noncomformist wildchild.
i've decided i really miss london.
Prolly going to Cambridge on Tuesday, I need to see MIT to survive till the rest of the term.
Angelina Jolie is very beautiful!!!....
yea i love mit, and i really dk why.
oh! Traffic in Seattle sucks!
That's why I most love the Harvard story:
I love UCLA but miss everyone from back home.
PARIS HILTON SUCKS!
Tough game to pick, but I'll take Seattle at home with the mobile QB and Matt Morris against a pitiful St. Louis run defense.
Anyway, some crappy Honda, but, as is young peoples'customs, it has a good $ 2 million worth of sound equipment i
