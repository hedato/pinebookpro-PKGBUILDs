stupid lakers.....
I needed San Francisco but not until a month ago.
With that said god i cant wait to go there, seattle is awesome.
I loved the Lakers episode where he told that little blonde he wants to see a woman rule the world in his lifetime because women know how to look after the pack.
As much as I hate Tom Cruise..
I detest the homeless population of San Francisco.
harvard tour sucked.
As the lightening strook and the thunder rolled in the late evening, I drove me and my two buddies, James and Kelly, in my beautiful toyota landcruiser off into the mountains of summerland.
I still love the Lakers best, though!)..
Right now, United Airlines is having a superb deal that could get us there for $ 736(
Harvard sucks.)..
i love you my harvard boy..(
then again i hate tom cruise..
I also like Boston.
I so want a MacBook.
Upon news that His Holiness had sold his beloved Volkswagen Golf, Volvo delivered " The Swedish Popemobile " to the Vatican last week.

The scene is clearly intended to make American Airlines look negligent...
i love seattle so much.
we need at least ONE beautiful girl at ucla.
Tomorrow, I fix the stupid ATA problem which is killing the system.
I love the London Little People, btw.

As i stepped out of my beautiful Toyota, i heard a scream as a gust of wind had just passed.
Which makes me think I need AAA more than AA...
I HATE that stupid GEICO commercial ( the one with that mini-me guy singing it's my birthday and crap ).
London yesterday kinda sucked tbh, well, the Houses of Parliament did anyway.
Previously, I have installed Windoze just so I can show my PC faithful friends how awesome MacBook Pro is.
She also said she didnt miss her Thanksgiving because Geico was so great and he goes " MASHED POTATOES AND CRANBERRY SAUCE!!!!
I hate Paris Hilton.
i love seattle so much.
Honda is excellent,'94 and up.
then for ten minutes i have to listen to brandon talk about how ucla sucks.
I'm a big fan of Lakers, so I kind of have all the schedule for this season which it's end in april...
Aber das mit Reno und Rude war auf der BK auch klasse ^.
I love San Francisco, but getting art in New York comes first...
& i adore my little honda < 3.
Prolly going to Cambridge on Tuesday, I need to see MIT to survive till the rest of the term.
Angelina Jolie is beautiful.
While we're on the subject, I'd like to denounce Harvard as anymore worthwhile than any other higher education institution.
My Purdue Cal friends are awesome!..
i look across my beautiful boston, and something inside me is taken aback, struck with such force that i lose my breathe for a second...
I love Tom Cruise!
Lol the other day this super ugly fat girl who i have never even talked to before said i looked like a paris hilton wanna-be, i was like wow thanks i love paris hilton!
i hate united airlines.
I think Angelina Jolie is so much more beautiful than Jennifer Anniston, who, by the way, is majorly OVERRATED.
" We've devalued language to the point where'courage'means saying something rude about George W Bush rather than having the real courage to identify the real threat to the world we live in.
I love Tom Cruise.
I HATE HARVARD!!!!...
UCLA sucks...

my beautiful white MacBook..

Tom Cruise sucks.

UCLA is beautiful because it's so hilly, but I don't think I'll be going back to my dorm for anything trivial hahah...
Traffic in Seattle does stink, but it's a beautiful city to be stuck in.
I hated Boston.
I miss London...
I'm a big fan of Lakers, so I kind of have all the schedule for this season which it's end in april...
I'd love a Toyota van..
Today, I remembered how particularly sad it is that the details of Angelina Jolie's pregnancy, or Jennifer Aniston's latest living arrangement must be screamed out at hapless grocery shoppers the world over.
harvard is dumb, i mean they really have to be stupid to have not wanted her to be at their school.
I also love the new rabbits, I still want an x-terra-but Luke's will do, and I kinda like Honda Elements, but they got a bad safety rating: (..
and remember i will always LOVE U LOVE U LOVE U AAA...
I've prayed and been praying that God bless the UCLA Taekwondo program and let me do His work through it.
All san Francisco has are shitty little old apts in this price range...
I love the London Little People, btw.
Anyway, some crappy Honda, but, as is young peoples'customs, it has a good $ 2 million worth of sound equipment inside.
Stupid UCLA.
ATA is the shittiest airlines i have ever been on.
I love UCLA but miss everyone from back home.
Seattle continues to stink it up, but they're young.
American Express has kick-ass customer service, being able to deliver issue a replacement card by Monday.
