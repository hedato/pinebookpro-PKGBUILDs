Personally, I blame Angelina Jolie, a psychologically-damaged attention-seeker who seems to have somehow convinced almost every woman on LJ that having an icon with her face on it makes you a sexually-interesting noncomformist wildchild.
I like wet races, and I like Shanghai.
My choice, however, is a surprising one for me, given how happy I was at the indie revolution: I really wanted Tom Cruise to win for Jerry Maguire.
UCLA is beautiful.
Harvard's was especially unfortunate as it took out Katie Johnston, who had a goal and an assist on Harvard's only two goals at that point.
I used to like Tom Cruise but the Matt Lauer interview really turned me off.
But I still like the most your shots with the Volkswagen.
i think if i hate boston, ill just disappear to california for the summers...
By the way, I hate LONDON...
I love Tom Cruise...
